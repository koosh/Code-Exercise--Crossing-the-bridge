Code exercise: Crossing the Bridge
------------------------------------
Found at https://twitter.com/honeypotio/status/669969447331983360

N people come to a river at night. There is a narrow bridge,
but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch
and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing
the bridge. Each person takes a variable amount of time to
cross.

When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at
the slower person's pace.

How fast can you get N people across the bridge.
------------------------------------
The algorithm implemented here has the fastest person cross
with the slowest, then go back and take the next slowest etc
but adds a variable bridge width so it more than two persons
can cross.

Sample usage in main.php.
